# Business Capability Modeling Tool

Easily generate and visualize Business Capability Models using this handy HTML page generator. Use either standard CSV or JSON files as a data baseline, this python utility leverages Plotly to quickly render BCMs in an HTML format. Any of your business users can easily create and/or modify the underlying data.

In addition to using alternative data formats (csv vs json, etc) we also demonstrate how to build the resulting treemaps with two distinct Plotly methods. The CSV example uses [Plotly Graph Objects](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/plotly.graph_objects.html) while the JSON example uses [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
